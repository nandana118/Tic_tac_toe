This project involves the development of a classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python.
The game is designed as a simple, interactive console-based application where two players, typically referred to as "X" and "O, " take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. 
The primary objective of the game is to align three of the same symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent. 
The program includes functionalities for checking the validity of moves, determining the game's outcome (win, loss, or draw), and displaying the game board after each turn.
Also reading user â€˜s name

OBJECTIVES:

Implement a command-line-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can participate interactively Allow players to input their names and use these names throughout the game for personalized turn messages.
Ensure proper alternation of turns between the two players, with feedback when invalid moves (e.g., selecting an already occupied position) are made. 
Implement logic to check for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) after each move. 
Provide a tie scenario if the board is fully occupied without any winning condition. 
Display the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board after every move to guide the players.
Maintain an intuitive and simple user interface to enhance the player's experience
